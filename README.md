# Chicago-Residents-Relocation-Analysis
## Executive Summary
People are leaving Illinois in droves. For the past five
years, Illinois population has declined by 157,000
residents. Making it one of only two state(The other is
West Virginia) to lose people over the past decade.
For this project, I dive into all the news articles for the past
few month to see what is the reason of this and found
some interesting thoughts. During this horrible pandemic,
Chicago has became the new epic center for the past
month and the lack of testing is driving people leaving the
city. Also, stateâ€™s high taxes and its unfunded pension
liability, lack of investment in education and infrastructure
are also the major factors that make people leave Illinois.

So what can government to do to make people love to live
in Illinois again? I will walk you thought this project and
draw the conclusion at the end of the project.
